buildupdate: Add workaround for flasher bug

Add a workaround to buildupdate.pl that never writes uncompressed
chunks and ensures that a compressed chunk never has a length of 1024
bytes. This is required to work around a bug in the flasher module in
version 3.0 to 3.0c.

PadReader: Use separate timeouts for reply and end-of-message

Split the timeout detection in the gamepad reader to allow for a

Remove the video->audio TIG constraint

According to reports, the version with the TIG constraint suffers from
audio noise on some FPGA boards, so it appears that some path is
under-constrained/not properly synched without it. Removing the TIG
does not cause any timing errors to pop up anymore after splitting the
clock enable counters in the audio subsystem.

Change ACR packet depending on the console mode

Add console mode detection for Wii

Add a detection of Cube vs. Wii mode when GCVideo-DVI is built for the
Wii. This is needed since Nintendo has fixed an off-by-one error in
the hardware so that the Wii uses exactly 48000Hz audio sample rate,
but that fix is disabled in Gamecube mode and thus the sample rate
shifts to 48042Hz there.
