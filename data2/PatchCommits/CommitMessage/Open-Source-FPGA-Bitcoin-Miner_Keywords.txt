Working on a new JTAG communication method for Spartan-6 devices. Seems to be working, though it has some bugs and needs a lot of polish.

======Commit: 6791f4c8======
======Short Message======
Many improvements to the Altera mining script. Split pool information out into config.tcl, with a config.example.tcl. Split the code up into mine.tcl, json_rpc.tcl, utils.tcl, and jtag_comm.tcl. Created a generic API for communicating with the FPGA, to abstract away firmware and chip specific details. Removed the dependency on TclCurl and using tcl's builtin http package instead. Cleaned out all the debugging output to console. Added estimation of hashrate based on chip's reported nonce, as well as an estimate based on number of submitted shares. Added tracking of accepted and rejected shares. Output to console is now timestamped. Console output is similar to poclbm's now. mine.tcl warns the user if the chip's current firmware won't report the actual hashrate. Added better error handling and reporting. Handling of getwork and submitting shares should also be a bit better. The generic FPGA API also allows moving the firmware to a hardware queue based system, without too many changes to the mining script.

LX150_makomk_Test: Added a testbench. Hacked together a fix for a bug in the K constant code. It was picking the wrong K constants. The fix works for LOOP_LOG2=1 and should work for LOOP_LOG2=0, but it won't work for other values of LOOP_LOG2. The code right now compiled just fine in ISE, and passed a testbench on the live hardware.

Added LX150_makomk_Test. Tests makomk's code on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX150T. Currently the code fits at LOOP_LOG2 and compiles correctly. 50MHz. However the chip does not return correct Golden Nonces. Need to debug in simulation.

A few modifications to udif's patch. Moved testing to a separate testbench. Created a testbenches folder with the first testbench in it. Tested udif's patch and it works for all LOOP_LOG2 settings from 0 to 5. Added golden_nonce adjustment code so the mining script no longer has to make the adjustments. Mining script updated with TODOs and removed the golden_nonce adjustments.

Yet another fix for loop rolling code.

This time the change seems to work:
1. Install Icarus verilog 0.9.4 (http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
2. go to source directory.
3. run icarus:
   iverilog -DSIM sha*.v fpgaminer_top.v
4. run with:
   a.out

You can use gtkwave.exe (if you are a Windows user,
it is bundled with the Windows MinGW-based icarus binary
(http://bleyer.org/icarus/)
