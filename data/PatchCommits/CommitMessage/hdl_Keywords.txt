data_offload: Improve external synchronization

This commit adds a new synthesis option to the design, that controls
whether an internal clock domain crossing will be generated. Disabling
this option allows you to use a synchronization signal that is
synchronized to the write clock domain externally, and possibly shared
between multiple devices.

The default value retains the old behavior.

adrv9009zu11eg & common/zcu102 : Fix zynqmp ref clock definition

The derived clocks of the zynqmp core are not calculated correctly due
rounding issues, instead of 100MHz the value of 99999001 is received
causing warnings during system validation.

This can be fixed/worked around with the proper reference clock
definition.

data_offload: Fix support for > 4 GiB of storage

This commit changes the transfer length register to work in increments of
64 bytes and without offset. The true transfer length can now be
determined by multiplying the value of the transfer_length register with
64.
A value of zero is interpreted as a request for all available storage.

Additionally, this commit fixes an off by one issue that was discovered
during testing of the RX path.

axi_pwm_gen: Fix offset mechanism

Fix offset for pwms with different periods.
The previous version was using an offset scheme based on pwm counter_0.
By using a separate offset counter the user will not be constrained by
pwm_0 period in regards with the offset of other pulses. In this version
offset 0 is used to delay pwm 0 in regards to the offset counter.

The offset counter will start after the load_config signal is asserted
and all active pwm counters finish the previous cycle or by a software
reset.

The software reset should also be used when using external_sync.

If all lanes are synchronized (CGS state machine is in DATA phase) for long
enough therefore the link is also synchronized/DATA phase reset the error
counter since the accumulated values during INIT/CHECK are irrelevant.
These errors are handled by the per-lane CGS state machine.

All errors accumulated during INIT/CHECK phase of CGS are relevant only
if the link is unable to reach the DATA phase.
The link stays in DATA phase unless software resets it,
so all errors accumulated during the DATA phase are relevant.

The previous implementation of the de-glitch only delayed the assertion
of the SYNC phase by 64 clock cycles with the DEGLITCH state but if meanwhile
one of the lanes got into a bad state cgs_ready de-asserted the state machine
continued to go SYNCHRONIZED (DATA) state.
This change extends the required number of consecutive cycles while all lanes
must stay in data phase before moving the link to SYNCHRONIZED state from 8 to 256;
This increases the reliability of link bring-up without needing extra
link restarts from software side.

jesd204_framework: Add Stratix10 support

This patch contains an initial effort to support the Stratix 10
architecture in our JESD204 framework.

Several instances were updated, doing simple context switching using the
DEVICE_FAMILY system parameter:

  - xcvr_reset_control
  - lane PLL (ATX PLL)
  - link PLL (fPLL)
  - native XCVR instance

Apart from the slightly different parameters of the instances above,
there were small differences at the reconfiguration Avalon_MM interface.

The link_pll_reset_control is required just for Arria10, so in case of
Stratix10 it isn't instantiated.

In Stratix 10 architecture there are several additional ports of the
xcvr_reset_control module that must be connected to the native XCVR
instance or tied to GND.

The following xcvr_reset_control ports were defined and connected to the
XCVR:

  - rx|tx_analogreset_stat
  - rx|tx_digitalreset_stat
  - pll_select

ad_dds: Fix noise caused by dac_data_sync

For projects where the clock ratio between the sampling clock and core clock
is higher than 2, the ad_dds generates a number of samples equal with
the clock ratio. There is a phase offset between the samples, proportional
with the requested DDS frequency.
In scenarios where the DDS out frequency is closer to the upper
limit(Nyquist) and/or the clock ratio is also greater than 2 and the
dac_data_sync reminds low for an extended period of time, the DAC will
receive at each core clock period, a number of samples equal with the
clock ratio and with an amplitude influenced by the DDS out frequency.
In most cases similar with a sawtooth signal.

With this commit we ensures that samples received by the DAC are 0 for
the period where dac_data_sync signal is high. Only when the signal
transitions to low, the phase accumulator is initialized and the phase
information is passed to the phase to amplitude converter.

Another issue can appear when the sync signal is too short; less then
CLK_RATIO * clock cycles. Because the phase accumulator will not
synchronize at all stages, the final result will be a random combination of
sine-waves. Added a minimum sync pulse after the dac_data_sync is set
low.

The commit 9ab88f1200099274853035bf75b8c23e70ce4ffb introduced a new
feature for the execution module, which provides the possibility to
delay the SDI line latch with one or more core clock cycle. Unfortunatly
the implementation was not correct and the SDI line was latched at the
wrong time.

This patch fix the aligment of the shift register and the SDI_DELAY parameter,
to latch the SDI line of the physical interface at the right time.

Improve the description of the feature.

======Full Message======
m2k: use DMA streaming interface

The previous mechanism was "probing" the DMAs for valid data. Better said,
each interpolation channel enabled it's DMA until a valid data was received,
then it disabled the DMA read and waited for the adjacent channel(DMA) to
receive a valid data. Only when for both channels had valid data on the
DMAs interfaces was the transmission started. This added an undesired and
redundant complexity to the interpolation channels. Furthermore, for continuous
transmission, using the above mechanism lead to a fixed phase(sample)
shift between the two channels at each start.

By using the streaming mechanism the interface is simplified and the
above problems are solved.

axi_adc_trigger: Fix two sample offset

When using a non-maximum sampling rate the data is captured earlier by two
samples.
After the initial trigger jitter fix, a low latency/utilization was
desired(one sample delay for the trigger detection). After adding the
instrument trigger an equal latency between ADC and LA was required, hence the
need for a two sample delay on the trigger path. The delay was implemented
as two clock cycle delays not two sample delays.
This commit fixes this issue and offers a more robust design.

axi_ad9361:xilinx:axi_ad9361_lvds_if: fix Rx latency

This commit reverts part of the changes done in the following commit:

- ff50963c7f839e7776655101b088742a43c7eb66 -
"axi_ad9361- altera/xilinx reconcile- may be broken- do not use"

The above mentioned commit introduced latency variations on the Rx path
at different sample rates, or within the same sample rate after sample
rate changes. The variation is caused by multiple positions of the frame
detection combined with a free running toggle (rx_valid) that is not synchronized
with the actual samples.

Having a single frame detection position eliminates the latency
variation.

axi_dac_interpolate: Fix channel sync mechanism
======Full Message======
axi_dac_interpolate: Fix channel sync mechanism

  The previous channel sync mechanism was simply holding the transmission by
pulling down the dma_rd_en of the two DMAs for each channel(set reg 0x50). After a
period of time (that will take the two DMAs to have the data ready to move)
the dma_rd_en was set for both channels, resulting in a synchronized start.
  This mechanism is valid when the two channels are streaming the same
type of data (constant, waveform, buffer or math) at close frequencies.
Streaming 10MHz on a channel and 100KHz on the second one will result
in different interpolation factors being used for the two channels.
  The interpolation counter runs only when the dma_transfer_suspended(reg 0x50)
is cleared. Because of this, different delays are added by the interpolation
counter one DMA with continuous dma_rd_en will have data earlier than the
one with dma_rd_en controlled by the interpolation counter. Furthermore,
because the interpolation counter value is not reset at each
dma_transfer_suspended, the phase shift between the 2 channels will
differ at each start of transmission.

  To make the transfer start synced immune to the above irregularities a
sync_transfer_start register was added (bit 1 of the 0x50 reg).
When this bit is set and the bit 0(dma_transfer_suspended) is toggled,
the interpolation counters are reset. Each channel enables it's DMA until
valid data is received, then it waits for the adjacent channel to get valid data.
This mechanism will be simplified in a future update by using a streaming
interface between the axi_dac_interpolate and the DMAs that does not require
the probing of the DMA.

======Full Message======
axi_adc_trigger: Fix low sampling rate external trigger acknoladge

The decimation module controls the valid signal. The whole triggering mechanism
is active only when the valid signal is active.
In the case of low sampling rates, the valid signal is active once every
n clock cycles. If an external trigger condition is fulfilled and the data valid
signal is low at the time, that trigger will be ignored by the DMA.

To solve this issue, the trigger is held high until the valid is asserted.
And it stays high for at least one clock cycle.

  ad_fmclidar1_ebz: Laser driver runs on ADC's core clock
  ad_fmclidar1_ebz_bd: Delete the FIFO instance

     Because the DMA transfers are going to be relatively small (< 2kbyte),
     the DMA can handle the data rate, even when the frequency of the laser
     driver pulse is set to its maximum value. (200 kHz)

     The synchronization will be done by connecting the generated pulse to
     the DMA's SYNC input. Although, to support 2 or 1 channel scenarios, we
     need to use the util_axis_syncgen module to make sure that the DMA
     catches the pulse, in cases when the pulse width is too narrow. (SYNC is
     captures when valid and ready is asserted)

     Also we have to reset the cpack IP before each pulse, to keep the DMA buffer's
     relative starting point in time fixed, when only 2 or 1 channel is
     active.

dac_fmc_ebz: Add initial Arria10 SoC support

Add support for the Arria 10 SoC development kit to the dac_fmc_ebz
project.

This allows to use the following FMC boards on the Arria 10 SoC development
Kit carrier:
  * AD9135-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9136-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9144-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9152-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9154-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9171-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9172-FMC-EBZ
  * AD9173-FMC-EBZ

Note that the board in its default configuration is not fully compatible with the
mentioned FMC boards and some slight re-work moving some 0 Ohm resistors is
required. The rework concerns the LA01 and LA05 pins, which by default are
not connected to the FPGA. The changes required are:

  LA01_P_CC
    R612: R0 -> DNI
    R610: DNI -> R0
  LA01_N_CC
    R613: R0 -> DNI
    R611: DNI -> R0
  LA05_P
    R621: R0 -> DNI
    R620: DNI -> R0
  LA05_N
    R633: R0 -> DNI
    R632: DNI -> R0

The main differences between AD9144-FMC-EBZ and AD9172-FMC-EBZ are:
  * The DAC txen signals are connected to different pins
  * The polarity of the spi_en signal is active low instead of active high
  * The maximum lane rate is up to 15.4 Gpbs

To accommodate this all 4 possible txen signals as well as the spi_en
signal are connected to GPIOs. Software can decide how to use them
depending on which FMC board is connected.

Note that each carrier has a maximum supported lane rate. Modes of the
AD9172 (and similar) that exceed the carrier specific limit can not be used
on that carrier. The limits are as following:
  * A10SoC: 14.2 Gbps

But this propagation does not work across the asynchronous meta data FIFO
in the burst memory module.

Add a DMA_LENGTH_ALIGN parameter to the burst_memory module which is used
to explicitly keep the LSBs of length registers on the destination side
fixed at 1'b1. This reduces resource use and improves timing by allowing
better constant propagation and unused logic elimination.

Add util_pack infrastructure

Pack and unpack operations are very similar in structure as such it makes
sense for pack and unpack core to share a common infrastructure.

The infrastructure introduced in this patch is based on a routing network
which can implement the pack and unpack operations and grows with a
complexity of N * log(N) where N is the number of channels times the number
of samples per channel that are process in parallel.

The network is constructed from a set of similar stages composed of either
2x2 or 4x4 switches. Control signals for the switches are fully registered
and are generated one cycle in advance.

Each individual link of a multi-link has its own sync signal. The top level
sync port that is created by the ad_xcvrcon function is always a single bit
single though.

This results in only the sync signal of the first link being routed while
others are ignored.

To fix this make sure that for multi-link setups the sync port is a vector
port with the width equal to the number of links.

ad_dds_2: Don't try to round if signal is not truncated

If DDS_DW is equal to DDS_D_DW there is no signal truncation and
consequentially no rounding should be performed. But the check whether
rounding should be performed currently is for if DDS_DW is less or equal to
DDS_D_DW.

When both are equal C_T_WIDTH is 0. This results in the expression
'{(C_T_WIDTH){dds_data_int[DDS_D_DW-1]}};' being a 0 width signal. This is
not legal Verilog, but both the Intel and Xilinx tools seem to accept it
nevertheless.

But the iverilog simulation tools generates the following error:

	ad_dds_2.v:102: error: Concatenation repeat may not be zero in this context.

Xilinx Vivado also generates the following warning:

	WARNING: [Synth 8-693] zero replication count - replication ignored [ad_dds_2.v:102]

Change the condition so that truncation is only performed when DDS_DW is
less than DDS_D_DW. This fixes both the error and the warning.

ad_ip_jesd204_tpl_dac: hw.tcl: Add mode validation

A converter typically only supports a specific subset of framer
configurations.

Add a configuration parameter to select a specific converter part number.
Based on the selected part a mode validation will be performed and if the
selected framer configuration is not supported by the part an error will be
generated.

This helps to catch invalid configurations early on rather than having to
first build the bitstream and then notice that it does not work.

When using "Generic" for the part configuration parameter no validation
will be done and any framer configuration can be selected.

ad_ip_jesd204_tpl_dac: hw.tcl: Choose lowest latency SAMPLES_PER_FRAME value

For a specific set of L, M and NP framer configuration parameters there is
an infinite set of possible values for the S and F configuration parameters
as long as S and F are integer and the following relationship is met

  S / F = (L * 8) / (M * NP)

Typically the preferred framer configuration is the one with the lowest
latency. The lowest latency is achieved when S is minimal.

Automatically compute and select this value for S instead of having the
user to manually provide a value.

Since some converters allow modes where S is not minimal provide a manual
overwrite to specify S manually in case somebody wants to use such a mode.

For completeness also add a read-only OCTETS_PER_FRAME (F) parameter that
can be used to verify and check which value for F was chosen.

There is no manual overwrite for F since if L, M, NP and S are set to a
fixed value there is only a single possible value for F, which is computed
automatically.

axi_dmac: Use AXI3 for DMAC in Intel projects

The buffers inside the interconnect are sized based on maximum burst sizes
the masters can produce.
For AXI4 the max burst size is 128 but for these projects for the
default burst size of 128 bytes the DMACs are creating only burst of 8 or
16 beats depending on the bus width (128bits and 64 bits respectively).

These burst sizes can fit in the AXI3 protocol where the max burst
length is 16. Therefore the interconnect will be reduced.

The observed reduction is around 4 Mb of block RAM per project.
Another benefit is a better timing closure,
since these buffers reside in the DDR3 clock domain.

jesd204_rx: Count errors only once per character

Typically only one of the character error conditions is true at a time. And
even if multiple errors were present at the same time we'd only want to
count one error per character.

For each character track whether at least one of the monitored error
conditions is true. Then count the number of characters for which at least
one error condition occurred. And finally add that sum to the total numbers

jesd204_rx: Reset lane error statistics when link is disabled

When the link is explicitly disabled through the control interface reset
the error statistics counter.

There is usually little benefit to preserving until after the link has been
disabled. If software is interested in the values it can read them before
disabling the link. Having them reset makes the behavior consistent with
all other internal state of the jesd204 RX peripheral, which is reset when
the link is disabled.

axi_dmac: fix 2d transfer address width

The index on MSB of addresses was set to 31,
but the width of address in the axi_dmac depends on a parameter.
The mismatch causes issues in the Xilinx simulator which does not extends the
narrower width signal with zeros, instead the wider signal gets 'Z' on its MSBs.
When the address was incremented with the stride it became 'X' due the uninitialized
MSBs.

axi_dmac: diagnostic interface in bursts

This change adds a diagnostic interface to the DMAC core.
The interface exposes internal information about the core,
information which can't be exposed through AXI registers
due the latency and update rate.

Such information is the fullness of the internal buffer.
For this is exposed in bursts and is driven from the destination
clock domain, as this is reflected in its name.

The signal has a fixed size and is dimensioned by
taking in account the supported maximum number of bursts of 128.

axi_dmac: add tlast to the axis interface for Intel

This change adds the TLAST signal to the AXI streaming interface
of the source side for Intel targets.
Xilinx based designs already have this since the tlast is part of the
interface definition.

In order to make the signal optional and let the tool connect a
default value to the it, the USE_TLAST_SRC/DEST parameter is
added to the configuration UI. This conditions the tlast port on
the interface of the DMAC.

Xilinx handles the optional signals much better so the parameter
is not required there.

axi_dmac: Enforce transfer length and stride alignments
======Full Message======
axi_dmac: Enforce transfer length and stride alignments

In its current implementation the DMAC requires that the length of a
transfer is aligned to the widest interface. E.g. if the widest interface
is 128 bits wide the length of the transfer needs to be a multiple of 16
bytes.

If the requested length is not aligned to the interface width it will be
rounded up.

This works fine as long as both interfaces have the same width. If they
have different widths it is possible that the length is rounded up to
different values on the source and destination side. In that case the DMA
will deadlock because the transfer lengths don't match and either not enough
of too much data is delivered from the source to the destination side.

Currently it is up to software to make sure that such an invalid
configuration is not possible.

Also enforce this requirement in the DMAC itself by setting the LSBs of the
transfer length to a fixed 1 so that the length is always aligned to the
widest interface.

Software can also use this to discover the length alignment requirement, by
first writing a zero to the length register and then reading the register
back. The LSBs of the read back value will be non-zero indicating the
alignment requirement.

In a similar way the stride needs to be aligned to the width of its
respective interface, so the generated addresses stay aligned. Enforce this
in the same way by keeping the LSBs cleared.

Increment the minor version number to reflect these changes.

All the debug signals are coming from the i_request_arb instance, so
include that in the match to avoid false positives.

For most projects this wont have been a problem since there is usually a
fair amount of slack on the paths that were affected by this. But in

Xilinx tools don't allow to use $clog2() when computing the value of a
localparam, even though it is valid Verilog.

For this reason a parameter was used for BYTES_PER_BURST_WIDTH so far. But
that generates warnings from both Quartus and Vivado since the parameter is
not part of the parameter list.

Fix this by changing it to a localparam and computing the log2() manually.
The upper limit for the burst length is known to be 4k, so values larger
than that don't have to be supported.

axi_dmac: Increase default store-and-forward memory size to 8 bursts

A larger store-and-forward memory provides better protection against worst
case memory interface latencies by being able to store more data before
over-/underflowing.

Based on empirical testing it was found that using a size of 4 bursts can
still result in underflows/overflows under certain conditions. These do not
happen when using a size of 8 bursts.

This change does not significantly increase resource consumption. Both on
Intel and Xilinx the block RAM has a minimum depth of 512 entries. With a
default burst length of 16 beats that allows for up to 32 bursts without
requiring additional block RAM.

library: Add a generic JESD204 DAC receiver core

For most of the DACs that use JESD204 as the data transport the digital
interface is very similar. They are mainly differentiated by number of
JESD204 lanes, number of converter channels and number of bits per sample.

Currently for each supported converter there exists a converter specific
core which has the converter specific requirements hard-coded.

Introduce a new generic core that has the number of lanes, number of
channels and bits per sample as synthesis-time configurable parameters. It
can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing converter specific
cores.

This has the advantage of a shared and reduced code base. Code improvements
will automatically be available for all converters and don't have to be
manually ported to each core individually.

It also makes it very easy to introduce support for new converters that
follow the existing schema.

Since the JESD204 framer is now procedurally generated it is also very
easy to support board or application specific requirements where the lane
to converter ratio differs from the default (E.g. use 2 lanes/2 converters
instead of 4 lanes/2 converters).

This new core is primarily based on the existing axi_ad9144.

For the time being the core is not user instantiatable and will only be
used as a based to re-implement the converter specific cores. It will be
extended in the future to allow user instantiation.

axi_dmac: Fix bus resize block reset

axi_dmac: Fix bus resize block reset

When the source and destination bus widths don't match a resize block is
inserted on the side of the narrower bus. This resize block can contain
partial data.

To ensure that there is no residual partial data is left in the resize
block after a transfer shutdown the resize block is reset when the DMA is
disabled.

Currently this is implemented by tying the reset signal of the resize block
to the enable signal of the DMA. This enable signal is only a indicator
though that the DMA should shutdown. For a proper shutdown outstanding
transactions still need to be completed.

The data that is in the resize block might be required to complete those
transactions. So performing the reset when the enable signal goes low can
lead to a situation where the DMA tries to complete a transaction but can't
do it because the data required to do so has been erased by resetting the
resize block. This leads to a dead lock and the system has to be rebooted
to recover from it.

To solve this use the sync_id signal to reset the resize block. The sync_id
signal will only be asserted when both the destination and source side
module have indicated that they are ready to be reset and there are no more
pending transactions.

axi_dmac: Prevent destination AXI burst length truncation

axi_dmac: Prevent destination AXI burst length truncation

The width of the AXI burst length field depends on the AXI standard
version. For AXI3 the width is 4 bits allowing a maximum burst length of 16
beats, for AXI4 it is 8 bits wide allowing a maximum burst length of 256
beats.

At the moment the width of the length signals are determined by type of the
source AXI interface, even if the source interface type is not AXI. This
means if the source interface is set to AXI3 and the destination interface
is set to AXI4 the internal width of the signal for all interfaces will be
4 bits. This leads to a truncation of the destination bus length field,
which is supposed to be 8 bits.

If burst are generated that are longer than 16 beats the upper bits of the
length signal will be truncated. The result of this will be that the
external AXI slave interface (e.g. the DDR memory) and the internal logic
in the DMA disagree about burst length.  The DMA will eventually lock up
when its internal buffers are full.

To avoid this issue have different configuration parameters for the source
and destination interface that configure the AXI bus length field width.

This way one of the interfaces can be configured for AXI3 and the other for
AXI4 without interfering with each other.

This commit fixes the following warning from the IP packaging flow:
"[IP_Flow 19-801] The last file in file group "Synthesis" should be an HDL file:
"axi_dmac_constr.ttcl".  During generation the IP Flow uses the last file to
determine library and other information when generating the top wrapper file.
If possible, please make sure that non-HDL files are located earlier in the list
of files for this file group."

Having the ttcl or other non HDL file at the end of the file group causes issues
when the project preferred language is set to VHDL. Since the synthesis file group
is set to "xilinx_anylanguagesynthesis" the tool tries to guess the type of wrapper
to be generated for that IP based on the last file from the file group.
If the file is non HDL then he defaults to the preferred language (this case VHDL)

Due some issue when the tool tries to create a VHDL wrapper for an IP that has
a Verilog top file with boolean parameters set from the IP packager he fails.
After we reorder the files after each non HDL file addition
he will create a correct Verilog wrapper for it with all parameters
which can be integrated in a VHDL system top file without issues.

Move Altera IP core dependency tracking to library Makefiles

Currently the individual IP core dependencies are tracked inside the
library Makefile for Xilinx IPs and the project Makefiles only reference
the IP cores.

For Altera on the other hand the individual dependencies are tracked inside
the project Makefile. This leads to a lot of duplicated lists and also
means that the project Makefiles need to be regenerated when one of the IP
cores changes their files.

Change the Altera projects to a similar scheme than the Xilinx projects.
The projects themselves only reference the library as a whole as their
dependency while the library Makefile references the individual source
dependencies.

Since on Altera there is no target that has to be generated create a dummy
target called ".timestamp_altera" who's only purpose is to have a timestamp
that is greater or equal to the timestamp of all of the IP core files. This
means the project Makefile can have a dependency on this file and make sure
that the project will be rebuild if any of the files in the library
changes.

This patch contains quite a bit of churn, but hopefully it reduces the
amount of churn in the future when modifying Altera IP cores.

Commit ff50963c7f83 ("axi_ad9361- altera/xilinx reconcile- may be broken-

This exposed some issues in the existing drivers which can cause the
interface tuning to fail randomly under certain conditions.

To keep backwards compatibility with existing drivers restore the previous
behavior.

A separate fix will be applied to the drivers that resolves the issue that
has been exposed by the polarity inversion. So that interface calibration
works reliably under all conditions.

axi_streaming_dma_rx_fifo: fix period_count clock and TLAST

The period_count should be updated once per clock cycle. This is not
enforced with the current implementation, which probably leads to
period_count being decremented on both m_axis_aclk edges.

A problem observed due to this is that the m_axis_tlast output is not
asserted or is asserted for a too short time for the consumer to
detect it.

Fix by letting the decrement (and thus the m_axis_tlast toggling)
happen only on the rising edge of the m_axis_aclk clock.

Also split things into two registers, this allows for an ID_WIDTH up to 8

util_adcfifo: Fix data corruption at faster DMA clock rates
======Full Message======
util_adcfifo: Fix data corruption at faster DMA clock rates

When the DMA clock to ADC data rate ratio exceeds a certain threshold it is
possible that an erroneous dma_waddr_rel toggle event is generated. This
causes the last address of the previous DMA transfer to be transferred to
the DMA domain. And the DMA side will start reading from the FIFO even
though data is not available yet.

This results in data corruption with the current transfer containing data
from the previous transfer.

The root cause here is that the toggle signal CDC synchronizer register are
reset in the DMA when a new transfer starts, but not in the ADC domain,
causing a potential mismatch and the incorrect toggle event. To fix this
remove the reset from the DMA side. This is OK since the registers are
self-resetting if the reset signal is asserted for more than 3 clock cycles.

The DMAC currently doesn't support transfers where the length is not a
multiple of the bus width. When generating the wstrb signal we do pretend
though that we do and dynamically generate it based on the LSBs of the
transfer length.

Given that the other parts of the DMA don't support such transfers this is
unnecessary though. So remove it for now and replace it with a constant
expression where wstrb is always fully asserted.

The generated logic for the wstrb signal was quite terrible, so this
improves the timing of the core.

axi_dmac: axi_dmac_hw.tcl: Automatically detect clock domains

Qsys allows to query to query the clock domain that is associated with a
clock input of a peripheral. This allows to automatically detect whether
the different clocks of the DMAC are asynchronous and CDC logic needs to be
inserted or not.

Auto-detection has the advantages that the configuration parameters don't
need to be set manually and the optional configuration will be choose
automatically. There is also less chance of error of leaving the settings
in a wrong configuration when e.g. the clock domains change.

In case the auto-detection should ever fail configuration options that
provide a manual overwrite are added as well.

The current code has a typo and checks the wrong signal. overwrite_data

configures whether the pin is in streaming or manual mode.

For correct operation the later signal should be used to decide whether a
direction change should be applied. Otherwise the direction change will
only be applied if the output value of the pin is set to logic high.

axi_adxcvr/util_adxcvr: Fix non-broadcast DRP access

When using non-broadcast access to the GT DRP registers lane filtering is
done on both sides. The ready and data signals are filtered in the in the
axi_adxcvr module and the enable signal is filtered in the util_adxcvr
module. This works fine as long as both sides use the same transceiver IDs.
E.g. channel 0 of the axi_adxcvr module is connected to channel 0 of the
util_adxcvr module.

But this is not always the case. E.g. on the ADRV9371 platform there are
two RX axi_adxcvr modules (RX and RX_OS) connected to the same util_adxcvr.
The first axi_adxcvr uses lane 0 and 1 of the util_adxcvr, the second uses
lane 2 and 3.

Non-broadcast access for the first RX axi_adxcvr module works fine, but
always generates a timeout for the second axi_adxcvr module. This is
because lane 0/1 of the axi_adxcvr module is connected to lane 2/3 of the
util_adxcvr and when ID based filtering is done both can't match at the
same time.

To avoid this perform the filtering for all the signals in the axi_adxcvr
module. This makes sure that the same base ID is used.

This also removes the sel signal from the transceiver interfaces since it
is no longer used on the util_adxcvr side.

Capture those events in the register map. This is useful for error

adi_ip.pl: Add support for creating multi busses

This patch adds a helper function that allows to create multiple ports for
a single set of underlying signals. This is useful when the number of ports
is a configuration parameter. It sort of allows the emulation of port
arrays without having to have on set of input/output signals for each port,
instead the signals are shared by all ports.

The following snippet illustrates how this can for example be used to
generate multiple AXI-Streaming ports from a single set of signals.

	module #(

	) (
		input [NUM_PORTS*32-1:0] data,

adi_ip.tcl: Set processing order of IP core constraint files back to late

Commit 2f023437b420 ("adi_ip- remove adi_ip_constraints") changed the
default processing order of IP core constraint files from late to normal.

This is problematic because some IP core constraint files try to access
clocks that are that are generated by different files with the normal
processing order level. These clock may or may not be available to the IP
core constraint file depending on the (random) order in which the files
were processed.

To avoid this issue change the default processing order back to late.

up_clock_mon: Make counter width configurable

The clock monitor reports the ratio of the clock frequencies of a known
reference clock and a monitored unknown clock. The frequency ratio is
reported in a 16.16 fixed-point format.

This means that it is possible to detect clocks that are 65535 times faster
than the reference clock. For a reference clock of 100 MHz that is 6.5 THz
and even if the reference clock is running at only 1 MHz it is still 65
GHz, a clock rate much faster than what we'd ever expect in a FPGA.

Add a configuration option to the clock monitor that allows to reduce the
number of integer bits of ratio. This allows to reduce the utilization
while still being able to cover all realistic clock frequencies.

up_clock_mon: Remove extra hold register

up_clock_mon: Remove extra hold register

Currently the clock monitor features a hold register in the monitored clock
domain. This old register is used to store a instantaneous copy of the
counter register. The value in the old register is then transferred to the
monitoring domain. Since the counter is continuously counting it is not
possible to directly transfer it since that might result in inconsistent
data.

Instead stop the counter and hold the registers stable for a duration that
is long enough for the monitoring domain to correctly capture the value.
Once the value has been transferred the counter is reset and restarted for
the next iteration.

This allows to eliminate the hold register, which slightly reduces
utilization.

The externally visible behaviour is identical before and after the patch.

m2k: zed: Fix default HDMI clock frequency

The input clock frequency of the axi_clkgen was changed from 200 MHz to
100 Mhz. Update the divider settings accordingly to keep the standard
default output frequency of 148.5 MHz.

The incorrect divider settings did not affect operation of the design since
software reprograms them at startup anyway, but changing them avoids the
following warning:
	[DRC 23-20] Rule violation (AVAL-46) v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1 - The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/axi_hdmi_clkgen/inst/i_mmcm_drp/i_mmcm. The computed FVCO is 445.455 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -1 is 600MHz to 1200MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 49.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 10.00000, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 11 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
	This violation may be corrected by:
	  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
	  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
	  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
	  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

axi_dmac: Configure AXI address width according to the mapped address space

Currently the AXI address width of the DMA is always 32-bit. But not all
address spaces are so large that they require 32-bit to address all memory.

Extract the size of the address space that the DMA is connected too and
configure reduce the address size to the minimum required to address the
full address space.

This slightly reduces utilization.

If no mapped address space can be found the default of 32 bits is used for
the address.

axi_adc_decimate: Gate unused filter parts

axi_adc_decimate: Gate unused filter parts

The minimum number of bits required for the adders in a CIC filter depends
on the decimation rate. Higher decimation factors require more bits. This
means for a multirate filter the size of the logic structures is determined
by the highest supported rate.

The current implementation of the filter always uses all bits of the
structure to compute the results, that means even when running with the
lowest decimation factor all the bits that are required for the highest
decimation factor are used. This will work fine as additional bits do not
affect the output of the filter.

This patch implements dynamic partial gating of the filter structure based
on the selected decimation factor. Bits that are not required for a certain
rates are gated and the carry bits are masked from propagating through the
adder chain. This results in significant power savings at smaller
decimation factors.

This means that the filter itself is now using more power the higher the
decimation rate. But this is offset by the reduced data output rate running
subsequent processing stages at a lower rate and reducing power consumption
there. This results in a more or less flat power profile regardless of
decimation factor.

m2k: standalone: Disable DMA debug registers

The debug register logic for the DMA take up a fair amount of resources.
Disabling them frees up space in the FPGA and also helps a bit with power.
Since those registers are mainly useful in development and not so much in
production the change shouldn't have any visible external effects.

It is possible to re-enable the debug registers by setting DEBUG_BUILD=1.

It seems that in the latest version a constant of "0" is no longer a valid

Not setting the enablement dependency correctly results in the AXI port to
be assumed to be read-write rather than just read or write. This will
generate unnecessary logic for example in interconnects to which the DMA
controller is connected.

axi_dmac: Fix constraints for ultrascale

Replace "PRIMITIVE_SUBGROUP == flop" with "IS_SEQUENTIAL" as the former is
series7 specific while the later works on all platforms. This fixes the
axi_dmac timing constraints for ultrascale based platforms.

======Commit: fe08222b======

Enable bitstream compression for Xilinx projects
======Full Message======
Enable bitstream compression for Xilinx projects

Enabling bitstream compression reduces the size of the generated bitstream.

This means on one hand it will consume less storage, which is especially
useful for the BOOT partition of the ADI images where we store BOOT.BIN
files for all supported platforms.

On the other hand a smaller bitstream is faster to load from the storage
medium and it is also faster to program to the FPGA. So it reduces the
overall boot time as well.

The only downside of bitstream compression is that the bitstream size is no
longer constant, but depends on the actual design and resource utilization.
This will not work with bootloaders that expect a fixed size.

When building a bitstream using the tcl scripts bitstream compression can
be disabled by setting the ADI_NO_BITSTREAM_COMPRESSION environment
variable.

Initial tests show a reduction of a round 50% in size for most ADI
projects.

util_dacfifo: Update read out method

Update the way how the fifo push out its content. By default the fifo pushes out all its content, if an xfer_last signal is received, the fifo saves the last write address, and reads out until the saved address.

axi_dmac: Change BRAM REGCEB constraint to set_false_path

According to the documentation when using a BRAM block in SDP mode the
REGCEB pin is not used and should be connected to GND. The tools though
when inferring a BRAM connect REGCEB to the same signal REGCEA. This causes
issues with timing verification since the REGCEB pin is associated with the
write clock whereas the REGCEA pin is associated with the read clock.

Until this is fixed in the tools mark all paths to the REGCEB pin as false
paths.

axi_dmac: Use sane defaults for the AXI protocol type
======Full Message======
axi_dmac: Use sane defaults for the AXI protocol type

The axi_dmac core generates requests which are both AXI3 and AXI4
compliant. This means it is possible to connect it to both a AXI3 or AXI4
slave port without needing a AXI protocol converter.  Unfortunately it is
not possible to declare a port as both AXI3 and AXI4 compliant, so the core
has the C_DMA_AXI_PROTCOL_SRC and C_DMA_AXI_PROTOCOL_DEST parameters, which
allow to configure the protocol type of the corresponding AXI master
interface. Currently the default is always AXI4.

But when being used on ZYNQ it is most likely that the AXI master interface
of the DMAC core ends up being connected to the AXI3, so change the default
to AXI3 if the core is instantiated in a ZYNQ design.

The default can still be overwritten by explicitly setting the
configuration property.

axi_hdmi_tx: Only mark HDMI clocks asynchronous to each other

Currently the axi_hdmi_tx core constraints marks all its clocks asynchronous
to all other clocks in the system. This is a bit unfortunate as these
constraints are not restricted to the axi_hdmi_tx, but affect all cores in
the system, some of which might actually have timing constraints on CDC
paths.

The proper way to fix this is to add constraints for the axi_hdmi_tx core
CDC paths. For now only mark the interface clock asynchronous to the HDMI
clock, as this is easy to do and an improvement over the current situation,
as other cores are no longer affected.

Tcl command "if" is not supported by Vivado XDC, therefore the tool throw some critical warnings, and does not

The following solution is much more compact and is supported by the XDC, and more importantly prevents
unwanted critical errors and timing violations.

zynq_plddr3: Fix PLDDR3's Reset Generator

Reset generator's external reset signal was active low, but the GT reset is active high, and both the DDR controller and FIFO2S were in reset.
Therefore the external reset active state is changed to active high. This setup in general is made by the tool automatically, in order to do it correctly, need to
set this two property of the reset generator.

Add Vivado version check to adi_project_create
======Full Message======
Add Vivado version check to adi_project_create

The scripts generating the projects files typically only work correctly with
one specific version of Vivado. If a incorrect version is used the script
may fail at some point with a cryptic error message or may not fail but
create a bitstream that is not working as expected, e.g. unconnected
signals, etc. This patch adds a version check to adi_project_create that
will error out early on stating that the wrong version of Vivado was used
and which is the right version to use.

By default the required version will be the version that is required by the
common scripts. Individual projects can overwrite the required version by
setting the REQUIRED_VIVADO_VERSION variable to the required version or can
bypass the version check completely by setting the IGNORE_VERSION_CHECK
variable to 1.

Callers of the script can also disable the version check by setting the
ADI_IGNORE_VERSION_CHECK environment variable.

In non-project mode (PR design flow), after creating the static design the type of the board is set.

NOTE: the definition file for mitx must be installed accordingly in order to get this work

util_dac_unpack: Fix unpack order with 1 channel

Due to the delay between the dac_valid and the fifo_valid signal we need to
have two counters. One counter which counts the number of incoming
dac_valid signals and generates the dma_rd signal and one counter for the
offset which gets set to 0 when fifo_valid is set.

This fixes issues with the unpack order when only one channel is active.

util_dac_unpack: Fix unpack order with 1 channel

Due to the delay between the dac_valid and the fifo_valid signal we need to
have two counters. One counter which counts the number of incoming
dac_valid signals and generates the dma_rd signal and one counter for the
offset which gets set to 0 when fifo_valid is set.

This fixes issues with the unpack order when only one channel is active.
