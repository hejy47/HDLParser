fpga_make.sh: /bin/sh -> /bin/bash

Since this script uses nonstandard "bashisms" (`[[ ]]`) and is called directly as `./fpga_make.sh` it should begin with `#!/bin/bash` rather than `#!/bin/sh` for systems in which `bash` is not the default shell.

======Short Message======
First pass in fixing tracemon to properly monitor memory operations again. Not working yet due to slight mismatch in pipeline sequences tracemon is expecting relative to what the current LSU is doing. Tracemon probably needs to be rethought to how it will track memory operations.

======Short Message======
Significantly overhaul the LSU. It now responds properly to memory requests and is considerably easier to debug. Unit tests still fail but that is likely more due to the framework's issues than the instructions themselves failing.
