fix one-off error in clock regen packet

The clock wrap counter was off by 1, so it had the chance
to cause some downstream issues for sinks. Would work for
most, but not all that rely on CTS to be exactly correct.

audio sample packet: always send 4 samples

audio sample packet: always send 4 samples

Some televisions seem to dislike the frequent sending of audio sample
packets with few samples (1 or 2) and will completely ignore the audio
that's being sent without any indication of an error.

This commit should deal with these TVs that are not fully compliant and
expect us to send >= 3 samples per packet, by always sending 4 samples.

I was using a set of load and clear registers, but now I've adopted a
buffer-swapping technique similar to double-buffering in video.

Fix incorrect info frame checksum

Checksum was one off because I assumed ~8'd12 + 8'd12 = 8'd255
(supposed to be 8'd0)

Adding stronger checks to the testbench to make sure things are right
and remain correct.

Fix audio padding for non 24-bit audio, closes #6
After examining IEC60958-1, it turns out that I
thought that a 16-bit sample would be LSB aligned
with a 24-bit sample, which is wrong: it is MSB
aligned. That way even if the source is
misconfigured for 24-bit when you're sending 16-bit
you can hear it but the quiet sounds might be clamped
and sound bad.
